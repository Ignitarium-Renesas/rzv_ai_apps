# RZ/V AI Applications 

## Overview
AI Applications and AI SDK on RZ/V series are provided as quick and easy solutions for starting AI.<br>
For more information, please refer to [here](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/latest/).<br>
This repository provides the various sample **RZ/V AI Applications**.<br>
To use the applications, please follow the `readme.md` file in the folder, where the each application is provided in. 

## Getting Started
To run AI Applications, users need to setup **RZ/V AI SDK**.<br>
Please follow [Getting Started](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/latest/getting_started.html) and start AI Applications and AI SDK.

## Functions of AI Applications list
The provided functions of AI Applications are listed as:

### 01. Head_count 
The [Head_count](./01_Head_count) application is used to count the human heads present in a video from camera input.
<br>
<br>
### 02. Line_crossing_object_counting
The [Line_crossing_object_counting](./02_Line_crossing_object_counting) is a sample application that demonstrates counting of the objects when they cross a virtual line drawn by the user. Application uses a deep learning based object detector YoloV3 to detect the objects and a SORT based tracker to track the objects.
<br>
<br>
### 03. Elderly_fall_detection
The [Elderly_fall_detection](./03_Elderly_fall_detection) application  enabled with vision based Ai examine human movement and perform activity recognition to detect falling events in input videos from camera.
<br>
<br>
### 04. Safety_helmet_vest_detection 
The [Safety_helmet_vest_detection](./04_Safety_helmet_vest_detection) application is used to detect the safety helmet and vest present in an image from camera input.
<br>
<br>
### 05_Age_gender_detection
The [Age_gender_detection](./05_Age_gender_detection) application is used to predict age-group and detect the gender of a perso in a video input.
<br>
<br>

### 07. Animal_detection
This [Animal_detection](./07_Animal_detection) is used to detect specific set of animals in camera inputs.
<br>
<br>
### 09. Human_gaze_detection 
The [Human_gaze_detection](./09_Human_gaze_detection) application has important information for applications such as Driver Monitor Systems to monitor driver's attentiveness. It can also help to analyse viewer's attention data in case of digital signage and retail industry.
<br>
<br>
### 10. Driver_monitoring_system
The [Driver_monitoring_system](./10_Driver_monitoring_system) application is basic variant of the DMS system. This has features like driver's head pose detection(left, right and center head pose), eye blink detection and yawn detection.
<br>
<br>

### 11. Head_count_topview 
The [Head_count_topvew](./11_Head_count_topview) application will count the human heads present in a video from camera input.
<br>
<br>

### 12. Hand_gesture_recognition_v2 
The [Hand_gesture_recognition_v2](./12_Hand_gesture_recognition_v2) application recognizes hand gestures like one, two, three, four five, thumbs up, thumbs down, 
and rock.
<br>
<br>
### 13. Car_ahead_departure_detection
The [Car_ahead_departure_detection](./13_Car_ahead_departure_detection) application is used to detects the movement of a car in the front away from a reference point from camera input.
<br>
<br>
### 14. Multi_camera_vehicle_detection
The [Multi_camera_vehicle_detection](./14_Multi_camera_vehicle_detection) application is used to detect 10 types of vehicles below from camera input.  
Also it can be used for these vehicles at 360 angle with multi cameras. Car, policecar, ambulance, bicycle, bus, truck, bike, tractor , auto and fire engine.
<br>
<br>
### 15. Road_lane_segmentation 
The [Road_lane_segmentation](./15_Road_lane_segmentation) application is used to segment road lanes in a video from camera input and generate a mask overlay on the lanes.
