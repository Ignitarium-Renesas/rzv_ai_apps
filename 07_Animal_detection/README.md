## Application: Build Stage

>**Note:** User can skip to the next stage (deploy) if they don't want to build the application. All pre-built binaries are provided.

This project expects the user to have completed [Getting Started](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/getting_started) provided by Renesas. 

After completion of Getting Started, the user is expected of following conditions.
- The board setup is done.
- SD card is prepared.
- Following docker container is running on the host machine.

   | Board| Docker container |
   | ---- | ---- |
   | RZ/V2H EVK | rzv2h_ai_sdk_container |
   | RZ/V2N EVK | rzv2n_ai_sdk_container |

    >**Note 1:** Docker environment is required for building the application.  
<!--    >**Note 2:** Since RZ/V2N is a brother chip of RZ/V2H, the same environment can be used.  -->

#### Application File Generation
1. On your host machine, download the repository from the GitHub to the desired location. 
    1. It is recommended to download/clone the repository on the `data` folder which is mounted on the docker container as shown below. 
    ```sh
    cd <path_to_data_folder_on_host>/data
    git clone https://github.com/Ignitarium-Renesas/rzv_ai_apps.git
    ```
    > Note 1: Please verify the git repository url if error occurs.

    > Note 2: This command will download whole repository, which include all other applications.<br>
     If you have already downloaded the repository of the same version, you may not need to run this command.
    
2. Run (or start) the docker container and open the bash terminal on the container.  
E.g., for RZ/V2H, use the `rzv2h_ai_sdk_container` as the name of container, created from  `rzv2h_ai_sdk_image` docker image.  
    > Note that all the build steps/commands listed below are executed on the docker container bash terminal.  

3. Set your clone directory to the environment variable.  
    ```sh
    export PROJECT_PATH=/drp-ai_tvm/data/rzv_ai_apps
    ```
4. Go to the application source code directory.  
    ```sh
    cd ${PROJECT_PATH}/07_Animal_detection/src
    ```
5. Build the application by following the commands below.  
    ```sh
    mkdir -p build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./toolchain/runtime.cmake ..
    make -j$(nproc)
    ```
6. The following application file would be genarated in the `${PROJECT_PATH}/07_Animal_detection/src/build` directory
   - animal_detection_app
     
<!--    >**Note:** Since RZ/V2N is a brother chip of RZ/V2H,  the same source code can be used.  -->


## Application: Deploy Stage
For the ease of deployment all the deployables file and folders are provided in following folder.
|Board | `EXE_DIR` |
|:---|:---|
|RZ/V2H EVK|[exe_v2h](./exe_v2h)  |
|RZ/V2N EVK|[exe_v2n](./exe_v2n)  |
<!-- >**Note:** Since RZ/V2N is a brother chip of RZ/V2H,  the same execution environment can be used.  -->

Each folder contains following items.
|File | Details |
|:---|:---|
|animal_yolov3_onnx | Model object files for deployment.|
|animal_detection_app | application file. |

1. Follow the steps below to deploy the project on the board. 
    1. Run the commands below to download the necessary file.
    ```
    cd ${PROJECT_PATH}/07_Animal_detection/<EXE_DIR>/animal_yolov3_onnx
    wget <URL>/<SO_FILE>
    ```
    |Board | `EXE_DIR` |`URL` |`SO_FILE` |File Location |
    |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
    |RZ/V2H EVK|[exe_v2h](./exe_v2h)  |<span style="font-size: small">`https://github.com/Ignitarium-Renesas/rzv_ai_apps/releases/download/v5.00`</span>  |<span style="font-size: small">`07_Animal_detection_deploy_tvm-v230.so`</span> |[Release v5.00](https://github.com/Ignitarium-Renesas/rzv_ai_apps/releases/tag/v5.00)  |
    |RZ/V2N EVK|[exe_v2n](./exe_v2n)  |<span style="font-size: small">`https://github.com/Ignitarium-Renesas/rzv_ai_apps/releases/download/v6.10`</span>  |<span style="font-size: small">`07_Animal_detection_deploy_tvm_v2n-v251.so`</span> |[Release v6.10](https://github.com/Ignitarium-Renesas/rzv_ai_apps/releases/tag/v6.10)  |

    2. Rename the `07_Animal_detection_deploy_tvm*.so` to `deploy.so`.
    ```
    mv <SO_FILE> deploy.so
    ```
    3. Copy the following files to the `/home/*/tvm` directory of the rootfs (SD Card) for the board.
        -  All files in <EXE_DIR> directory. (Including `deploy.so` file.)
        -  `07_Animal_detection` application file if you generated the file according to [Application File Generation](#application-file-generation)

2. Folder structure in the rootfs (SD Card) is shown below.<br>
   Check if `libtvm_runtime.so` exists in the rootfs directory (SD card) on the board.
- For RZ/V2H
```sh
├── usr/
│   └── lib64/
│       └── libtvm_runtime.so
└── home/
    └── root/
        └── tvm/ 
            ├── animal_yolov3_onnx/
            │   ├── deploy.json
            │   ├── deploy.params
            │   └── deploy.so
            ├── labels.txt
            └── animal_detection_app
```
   - For RZ/V2N
```sh
├── usr/
│   └── lib/
│       └── libtvm_runtime.so
└── home/
　　└── weston/
　　　　└──  tvm/
            ├── animal_yolov3_onnx/
            │   ├── deploy.json
            │   ├── deploy.params
            │   └── deploy.so
            ├── labels.txt
            └── animal_detection_app
```

>**Note:** The directory name could be anything instead of `tvm`. If you copy the whole `exe_v2h` folder on the board. You are not required to rename it `tvm`.

## Application: Run Stage

1. On the board terminal, go to the `tvm` directory of the rootfs.
   - For RZ/V2H
    ```sh
    cd /home/root/tvm
    ```
   - For RZ/V2N
    ```sh
    cd /home/weston/tvm
    ```
2. Run the application with USB camera input.
   - For RZ/V2H
    ```sh
    ./animal_detection_app USB
    ```
   - For RZ/V2N
    ```sh
    su
    ./animal_detection_app USB
    exit    # After pressing ENTER key to terminate the application.
    ```
>**Note:** For RZ/V2N AI SDK v6.00 and later, you need to switch to the root user with the 'su' command when running an application.<br>
This is because when you run an application from a weston-terminal, you are switched to the "weston" user, which does not have permission to run the /dev/xxx device used in the application.<br>

3. Following window shows up on HDMI screen*.  
   <img src="./img/app_run.png" alt="Sample application output"
     margin-right=10px; 
     width=600px;
     height=334px />  
*Performance in the screenshot is for RZ/V2H EVK.

4. To terminate the application, switch the application window to the terminal by using Super(windows key)+ Tab and press ENTER key on the terminal of the board.
